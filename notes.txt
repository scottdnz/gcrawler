t_crawler project notes:


Need to carry on with StoredResultsParser file - sqlite commands
would be good to have a config class

put on github
Transfer to pi - git
-Need composer, sqlite package, sqlite db set up in /opt, 

Plan to run live searches once a week, or batch per night?
-would be good to schedule as a service...
Store results HTML files in /data, parse them & store in sqlite db.

apt-get install sqlite3
cd /opt
mkdir sqlite_dbs
cd sqlite_dbs
sqlite3 gcrawler.db (creates database)

apt-get install php-sqlite3
