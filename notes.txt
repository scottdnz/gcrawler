t_crawler project notes:


Need to carry on with StoredResultsParser file - sqlite commands
would be good to have a config class

put on github
Transfer to pi - git
-Need composer, sqlite package, sqlite db set up in /opt, 

Plan to run live searches once a week, or batch per night?
-would be good to schedule as a service...
Store results HTML files in /data, parse them & store in sqlite db.
